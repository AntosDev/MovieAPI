# MovieAPI

<h1>Simple Movie API using NestJS</h1>

<h2>To Run:</h2>
<pre>
- docker compose up and wait (it will take some time to run the db migrations)

- Enjoy
</pre>
How it was developed:
The development tried to adhere as much as possible to SOLID (especially IoC), hexagonal architecture (dependencies are outwards) and DDD maintaining a clean domain and application latyer

The source code contains:
    - main files containing docker files, cofigurations and .env
    - under src
        - external providers: implementation of wrapper around omd (since we have IoC the module will use the interface and not the actual implementation)
        - healthcheck: the hello world APIs generated by nest
        -  modules:
            - userauths: (the authentication stuff, does not strictly follow DDD as there is no need)
                - application: the local and JWT strategies (the implementations needed to validate credentials, generate tokens and validate them; followed nestjs official documentation)
                - domain: contains the entities used by the module
                - infra: 
                    - http: the auth controller containing the ('auth/login') api
                    - data-access: the user database entity the repository used to retrieve users
                - the module.ts which is linking it all together
            - movies: (this is the core module of the application and does adhere to tactical patterns of DDD)
                - application: 




you can see the DDD and hexagonal architecture influences in the movies module

Steps:

1- nest new movie-api with npm
2- build project structure - moudlar - application containing the use cases - domain containing the domain objects and logic - infra: containing both http (controllers) and data-access (entities, repositories implementation)
3- added online movies provider, used explicit injection instead of injection by interface to respect hexagonal architecture reference: https://github.com/fmcarrero/nest-js-products-api
4- fix movies domain functionality
5- added repository (no DB access yet)
6- link the above together orchastrated in the use case

7- implement authentication module (following nestjs official documentation)
8- add local and jwt guards
9- guard create movie APi by JWT token

10- create entities and install typeORM packages
11- create docker files for postgres
12- create database from typeORM to postgres docker

13- save vreated movie in DB
14- Get authenticated user from context
15- implement business logic
16- implement get movies

17- implement unit tests for movies use cases

18- dockerise nestjs

Decisions:
NestJS
Monolith
some DDD tactical patterns
Hexagonal as possible
